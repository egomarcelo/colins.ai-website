      <h4>What is ISO/IEC 42001?</h4>
      <p>
        ISO/IEC 42001 mandates that AI systems must be explainable. Standard deep learning models are often black boxes. They provide answers, but cannot explain why. In banking, the greatest risk is liability. We handle this with the architecture of our Graph Neural Networks.

        <h4>Explainable AI</h4>
        <p>Every risk score generated by our GNN is accompanied by readable Code and a visual map of the suspicious network connections. We don't just tell you a transaction is risky, we show you the specific star topology or mule chain that triggered the alert.</p>

        <h4>Graph Neutrality</h4>
        <p>By design, our GNN architecture focuses on network structures, such as the relationships between devices and accounts, which are inherently more objective indicators of fraud than traditional demographic profiling.</p>

        <h4>Continuous Monitoring</h4>
        <p>
          We monitoring the GNN constantly to detect Data Drift. If the patterns of normal banking behavior shift (e.g., during a holiday season), our system alerts our data scientists immediately, preventing false positives from spiking. Our system also learns from your analysts. When a human reviewer confirms or rejects a fraud alert, that feedback is securely fed back into the system, allowing the GNN to adapt to new fraudster tactics without manual reprogramming.

        <h4>Human-in-the-Loop</h4>
        <p>
          We view AI as a precision tool for your investigators, not a replacement for human judgment. You define the boundaries. You can set the system to Auto-Block only on extreme confidence scores (e.g., >99% probability of a known Mule Ring), while routing complex, gray area cases to human experts for review.
