      <h4>What is ISO/IEC 27001?</h4>
      <p>
        ISO/IEC 27001 is the global gold standard for Information Security Management. You can think of it as Good Manufacturing Practice for data. Just as you have strict physical protocols to prevent contaminants from entering a dry room, ISO 27001 provides strict digital protocols to prevent data from unauthorized access, use, or leakage. It ensures that security remains a documented, audited, and continuous process.

        <li>Single-Tenant Architecture: We do not train a "master model" on mixed client data. For every project, we spin up an isolated, containerized environment. Your data trains your specific instance of the GNN, and that instance is wiped or archived offline immediately after project completion.</li>
        <li>Data Classification: All chemical inputs (SMILES strings, PDB files) are classified as "Top Secret" automatically upon ingestion, triggering our strictest access protocols.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Encryption in Transit: All data sent between your Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN) and our inference servers is encrypted using TLS 1.3.</li>
        <li>Encryption at Rest: Once your data lands in our secure cloud environment, it is encrypted using AES-256 standards. Even if a physical drive were stolen from a data center, the chemical data within it would be mathematically impossible to read.</li>

        <li>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Only the specific machine learning engineers assigned to your project have decryption keys for your dataset. A developer working on our "Physics Oracle" code cannot access your specific target protein data.</li>
        <li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Every access point to our internal systems requires hardware-based MFA, ensuring that compromised passwords do not lead to compromised IP.</li>

        <li>Supply Chain Security: We only source fragment libraries from verified vendors (like Enamine) and validate all open-source physics engines (like AutoDock Vina) against known vulnerability databases (CVEs) before they are deployed in your environment.</li>
        <li>Input Validation: Our API automatically sanitizes all chemical inputs to prevent "injection attacks" that could attempt to manipulate the underlying code of the GNN.</li>
