      <h4>What is ISO/IEC 27001?</h4>
      <p>
        ISO/IEC 27001 is the global gold standard for Information Security Management. You can think of it as Good Manufacturing Practice for data. Just as you have strict physical protocols to prevent contaminants from entering a dry room, ISO 27001 provides strict digital protocols to prevent data from unauthorized access, use, or leakage. It ensures that security remains a documented, audited, and continuous process.

        <h4>How We Protect Your IP</h4>
        <p>Colins.ai eliminates any risk of model leakage through a strict architectural separation:</p>

        <li>We Supply the Physics (Public): Our base models are trained on universal laws of thermodynamics, mechanics, and diffusion equations. This is public knowledge and contains no trade secrets.</li>
        <li>You Supply the Chemistry (Private): Your specific material properties, manufacturing parameters, and failure data are used only to fine-tune the model for your specific project.</li>
        <li>The Firewall: We use single-tenant architecture. This means your data is processed in its own isolated environment. Your proprietary chemistry never trains our base model, ensuring that your insights never benefit another client.</li>

        <li>Private Cloud Isolation: For standard deployments, we spin up a dedicated, encrypted environment that is accessible only to the engineers assigned to your project.</li>
        <li>On-Premise "Air-Gapped" Delivery: For our most sensitive partners, we offer on-premise deployment. We package our Physics-Informed Neural Networks into secure containers that run entirely on your internal servers, behind your own firewalls. In this scenario, your data never leaves your facility, and the model runs without an internet connection.</li>

        <h4>Avoiding Supply Chain Risk</h4>
        <p>
          When you partner with Colins.ai, you are preparing for your future manufacturing scaling and exit. Large automotive OEMs and acquirers conduct rigorous due diligence on software supply chains. Using non-compliant, "black box" AI tools can raise red flags during an audit.

Our adherence to ISO/IEC 27001 standards ensures that your data handling processes meet the rigorous expectations of global OEMs. We protect your data today so that you pass due diligence tomorrow.
