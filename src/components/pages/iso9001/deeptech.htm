      <h4>Why ISO 9001?</h4>
      <p>
        In the development of Solid-State Batteries, almost right is a failure. A simulation that is 90% accurate might miss the real world scenarios where a dendrite short-circuits the cell. We apply ISO 9001 principles to ensure that our Physics-Informed Neural Networks deliver results that are reproducible, traceable, and validated against the real world.

        <h4>Deterministic Workflows</h4>
        <p>In standard AI, running the same model twice can sometimes yield slightly different answers due to random elements in the training process. In manufacturing, this is unacceptable. We engineer our training pipelines to be deterministic. If you input the same material parameters (conductivity, pressure, temperature) today, you will get the exact same simulation result as you did six months ago. Every assumption made in the model is documented and locked, ensuring that your Virtual Lab is as consistent as your physical one.</p>

        <h4>Real World Conditions</h4>
        <p>The greatest risk is having a model that works perfectly on a computer but fails in the factory. We do not rely solely on data correlation. We validate every model against the fundamental laws of physics (Conservation of Mass, Charge, and Energy). If a prediction violates these laws, our Quality Assurance protocols flag it as invalid before you ever see it. We also test our PINNs against a blind set of your historical lab data to mathematically quantify the error margin. We tell you exactly how accurate the model is so you know how much to trust it.</p>

        <h4>Traceable Data</h4>
        <p>When a physical battery fails in the field, you find which batch it came from. We apply the same traceability for our digital simulations. We track every data point from ingestion to prediction. If a simulation predicts a safe cycle life, we can trace exactly which version of the physics kernel and which slice of your training data produced that conclusion. As we refine the PINN to account for new battery chemistries, we maintain a strict history. </p>
